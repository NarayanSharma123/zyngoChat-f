            Welcome to <strong>ZyngoChat</strong>. These Terms & Conditions
            ("Terms") describe the rules and policies that govern your use of
            the ZyngoChat app and any related services, websites, or features
            provided by the developer. By installing, accessing, or using
            ZyngoChat you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with any
            part of these Terms, please do not use the app.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">1. Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            ZyngoChat is an independent project created and maintained by a
            single developer. There is no company or team behind the project at
            this time. Contact details and the in-app Contact page will be the
            primary way to get support or ask questions about these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By creating an account, signing in, or otherwise using ZyngoChat,
            you represent that you are at least the minimum legal age required
            in your country and that you agree to these Terms. These Terms
            constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the
            developer.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">3. Account registration</h2>
          <p>
            To use ZyngoChat you must register with a phone number and provide
            certain basic information (for example: first name, last name,
            email, profile image). You are responsible for keeping your login
            credentials, including your password, secure. We store passwords in
            hashed form on the server — plain-text passwords are never kept. You
            are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">4. Allowed use</h2>
          <p>
            ZyngoChat is provided to let you communicate with others using
            messages, emojis, and photos (current features). Future updates may
            include voice messages, voice and video calling, file sharing (PDFs,
            videos, other documents), group features (group name,
            description/about, adding members), contact import, and invite
            messages. You agree to use the app only for lawful and permitted
            purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of others.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">5. User responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for the content you create, send, or
            share through ZyngoChat. Prohibited behaviour includes but is not
            limited to: harassment; threats; illegal activities; impersonation;
            spamming; distributing malware; sharing copyrighted content without
            permission; and any activity that materially harms or interferes
            with others’ use of the service.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">
            6. Content moderation & blocking
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a solo developer, ZyngoChat does not proactively monitor private
            messages. However, the app provides features for users to block or
            report other accounts. If reports indicate a clear violation of
            these Terms (or local law), the developer reserves the right to
            suspend or terminate accounts, remove content, or take other
            reasonable actions to protect users and the service.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">7. Privacy & encryption</h2>
          <p>
            ZyngoChat places emphasis on user privacy. Messages are designed to
            be end-to-end encrypted so that only sender and recipient can read
            them. The developer does not access plain-text message content. Some
            delivery metadata or temporarily encrypted message data may be
            stored on the server only for delivery purposes; undelivered
            messages may be removed after a reasonable period. See the Privacy
            Policy for exact details about data collection, retention, and
            third-party services.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">8. Third-party services</h2>
          <p>
            Some features may rely on third-party providers (for example,
            Firebase for auth or Cloudinary for media storage). These providers
            process limited technical data needed to operate those features.
            ZyngoChat uses such services under agreements that limit how they
            may use your data. The developer does not grant third parties
            permission to read your private content.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">9. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use standard security practices (HTTPS, hashed passwords, secure
            storage, input validation) to protect user accounts and data.
            However, no service is completely immune to risk. You should keep
            your device and login information secure and report suspicious
            activity promptly. The developer will make reasonable efforts to
            patch known vulnerabilities and update the app.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">10. Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            The app, its design, features, text, logos, and other content are
            the intellectual property of the developer unless otherwise stated.
            You are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use ZyngoChat
            under these Terms. You may not copy, redistribute, alter, or create
            derivative works from the app or its assets beyond what is necessary
            for normal personal use without prior written permission.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">
            11. Account suspension & termination
          </h2>
          <p>
            The developer may suspend or terminate access to your account if you
            violate these Terms, engage in unlawful conduct, or otherwise
            threaten the security or stability of the app. In such cases, the
            developer will take reasonable steps to notify you when possible.
            Termination will not affect other users’ copies of messages you
            already sent to them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">12. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
          <p>
            ZyngoChat is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The
            developer makes no express or implied warranties about uninterrupted
            service, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
            While the developer strives to maintain the app and address issues,
            you use the service at your own risk.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">13. Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the developer
            will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential
            or punitive damages arising from your use of ZyngoChat, including
            but not limited to lost profits, data loss, or interruption of
            business. The developer’s aggregate liability for direct damages is
            limited to the amount you have paid (if any) for the service in the
            prior twelve months or a small fixed cap as permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">14. Changes to the Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are
            significant, we will provide notice within the app or through other
            reasonable means. Continued use of ZyngoChat after a change means
            you accept the new Terms. You should check this page periodically.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">15. Governing law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which
            the developer resides, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
            If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable,
            that provision will be limited or removed to the minimum extent
            necessary and the remaining Terms will continue in full force.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">16. How to contact us</h2>
          <p>
            If you have questions, complaints, or requests about these Terms,
            please reach out via the Contact page in the app. As a one-person
            project, response times may vary, but every valid inquiry will be
            considered in a reasonable time.
