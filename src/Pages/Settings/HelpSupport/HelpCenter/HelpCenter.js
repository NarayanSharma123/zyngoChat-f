        Welcome to the ZyngoChat Help Center. This page is designed to help you
        understand how to use ZyngoChat, troubleshoot common issues, and learn
        about the features currently available. ZyngoChat is developed and
        maintained by a single developer, so information here reflects the
        current version of the app. Updates will be made as new features are
        added.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Download and Install:</strong> Download ZyngoChat from the
        official app store or a trusted link provided by the developer. Install
        it on your device.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sign Up:</strong> On the Sign Up screen, enter your First Name,
        Last Name, Email, and Password. You may optionally upload a profile
        image. Click "Create Account" to complete registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Login:</strong> If you already have an account, go to the Login

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Account & Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy matters to us. Passwords are stored securely using hashing
        methods and are never saved in plain text. Chats are end-to-end
        encrypted, meaning only you and your chat partner can read them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Logout:</strong> While logged in, go to your Dashboard page.
        Click the three-dot icon next to your profile, choose "Settings," open
        the Account tab, and scroll down to find the "Logout" button. Clicking
        this will log you out and return you to the login page.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Messages & Media</h2>
