            This License describes the rights and limitations that apply to your
            use of ZyngoChat (the “App”), including the App, related services,
            website content, design, and any associated software, documentation,
            or content provided by the developer. ZyngoChat is developed and
            maintained by a single developer. By installing or using the App you
            accept this License. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">1. Ownership</h2>
          <p>
            All intellectual property rights in the App, including but not
            limited to the source code, binaries, images, icons, logos, visual
            design, text, and other content, are owned by the developer unless
            otherwise stated. All rights not expressly granted to you are
            reserved by the developer.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">2. Grant of License</h2>
          <p>
            Subject to these terms, the developer grants you a limited,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Download, install, and use a copy of the App on devices you own or

          <p>You must not:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
              or create derivative works of the App or its content beyond what
              is permitted under this License.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, attempt to derive the
              source code of the App, or otherwise attempt to defeat any
              technical protections, except to the extent applicable law
              prohibits this restriction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sell, rent, lease, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer
              rights to the App or any part of it.
            </li>

            <li>
              Use the App to host, store, or deliver illegal content, spam,

            <li>
              Use automated means (bots, scrapers, crawlers) to access, index,
              or collect data from the App unless expressly permitted.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">
            4. User Content & Responsibility
          </h2>
          <p>
            You remain responsible for the content you create, send, or upload
            via the App. You represent and warrant that you have all rights
            necessary to transmit or share any content you submit, and that
            doing so does not infringe the rights of any third party or violate
            applicable laws. The developer is not responsible for user-generated
            content and may remove content that violates these terms or local
            laws.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">
            5. Third-Party Components & Services
          </h2>
          <p>
            The App may include or rely on third-party software, libraries,
            services, or platforms (for example React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase,
            Cloudinary). Those components are subject to their own license
            terms. Use of third-party services (including any data processing
            they perform) is governed by the applicable third-party terms and
            privacy policies. The developer will list known third-party
            components in project documentation where practical.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">6. Updates & Modifications</h2>
          <p>
            The developer may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the App
            (or the entire App) at any time with or without notice. Where
            required by law, the developer will provide notice of material
            changes. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the
            updated License.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">7. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            This License is effective until terminated. The developer may
            suspend or terminate this License and your access to the App
            immediately if you breach any term of this License, engage in
            prohibited conduct, or as required by law. Upon termination, you
            must cease all use of the App and delete all copies in your
            possession or control. Termination will not affect rights the
            developer may have under applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">8. Export & Use Restrictions</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to comply with all applicable export control, economic
            sanctions, and trade regulations when using or distributing the App.
            You must not use, export, re-export, or import the App in violation
            of any applicable laws or regulations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">9. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum
            extent permitted by applicable law, the developer disclaims all
            warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but
            not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. The developer does
            not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure,
            or free of harmful components.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
            the developer be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or in
            connection with your use of the App, including loss of data, loss of
            profits, or loss of business opportunity, even if the developer has
            been advised of the possibility of such damages. The developer's
            total aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the
            greater of (a) the amount you have actually paid to the developer
            for the App in the prior twelve (12) months (if any), or (b) a
            modest statutory cap permitted by applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">11. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the developer from
            any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including
            reasonable legal fees) arising from your violation of this License,
            your misuse of the App, or your infringement of third-party rights.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">
            12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
          </h2>
          <p>
            This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the jurisdiction where the developer resides, except to
            the extent local law requires otherwise. You and the developer agree
            to seek to resolve disputes amicably, and if legal action is
            necessary, you consent to the reasonable jurisdiction and venue for
            actions consistent with applicable law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">13. Assignment</h2>
          <p>
            The developer may assign or transfer its rights and obligations
            under this License (for example, in connection with a sale or
            merger). You may not assign your rights or obligations under this
            License without the developer's prior written consent.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">14. Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision of this License is found to be illegal, invalid, or
            unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be limited
            or removed to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining
            provisions will continue in full force and effect.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">15. Notices</h2>
          <p>
            The developer may provide notices or communications under this
            License via the App, via the contact information you supply, or by
            posting notices within the App or on the official website. It is
            your responsibility to keep your contact details up to date.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium">16. Contact</h2>
          <p>
            For licensing questions, permissions requests, or other legal
            notices, please use the Contact page in the ZyngoChat app. Because
            ZyngoChat is an independent project managed by a single developer,
            response times may vary, but every reasonable inquiry will be
            considered.
